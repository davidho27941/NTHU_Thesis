\section{MC samples}\label{sec:MC sample}
For data preparation, we generate our dataset using a custom docker image with MadGraph\_aMC@NLO(v2.7.2), Pythia8(v.8.2), and Delphes(v3.4.2) for showering, hadronization, and detector simulation. We apply the ATLAS parametrization during detector simulation.  The data are generated at Leading Order(LO) quantum chromodynamics(QCD). The top mass is configured as $m_{\rm top}=173$ GeV. The W quark decay is forced hadronically into a $(q, q')$ pair. The following is our configuration:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Configuration for generating samples. The ``iseed'' is just a placeholder, it will be changed when generating samples.},captionpos=b]
	generate p p > t t~ QED=0, (t > W+ b, W+ > j j), (t~ > w- b~, w- > j j ) 
	output <file_path> 
	launch <file_path> 
	shower=Pythia8  
	detector=Delphes 
	analysis=OFF 
	done  
	set nevents = 10000 
	set iseed = 1 
	Delphes/cards/delphes_card_ATLAS.tcl
	done 
	exit 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{adjustbox}
\\
To get a more general performance, we scan the iseed value from 1 to 30000, each value has 10 thousand events before event selection. The reason for scanning iseed value is that the iseed value is the key to the random data generation. Originally, the program will choose the iseed value randomly and generate different samples. By scanning the issed value, we can make sure the seed is not reused.
