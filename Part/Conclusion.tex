\chapter{Conclusion}

We accomplishd a novel approach to parton-jet assignment using a symmetry preserving attention mechanism. This network is able to learn the permutation symmetry that appears in a physics process and achieves a remarkable performance. Utilizing this architecture can significantly improves the performance and reduce the cost of computing time. We showed that a well-trained deep learning network can replace permutation-based algorithms and avoid the combinatorial explosion by estimating symmetry-aware pairwise similarities.
\\
In addition, this novel architecture cannot only enables more efficient study of hadronic top decay parton-jet assignment problems; it also can be generalized to other models which also contain the permutation symmetry. A model with BSM interactions, such as tri-Higgs production in 2HDM model and the four top production contains two spectors, will be our next step for exploring BSM physics with this architecture.
