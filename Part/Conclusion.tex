\chapter{Conclusion}

We perform a novel approach to parton-jet assignment using a symmetry preserving attention mechanism. This network could learn the permutation symmetry that appears in a physics process and archives a remarkable performance. Using this architecture can lead to a great improvement of performance and reduce the cost of computing time. And we showed that a well-trained deep learning network can replace the permutation based algorithms and avoid the combinatorial explosion by estimating symmetry-aware pairwise similarities.
\\
Also, this novel architecture can not only provide an improvement to all hadronic top decay parton-jet assignment problems but also can be generalized to other models which also contain the permutation symmetry.
